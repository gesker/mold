Make Sure you have a local PostgreSQL Database installed
This Project was built using PostgreSQL 11, PostGis and Contrib install packages on a Debian/Ubuntu 18.10 System

Create or edit the file:

/etc/apt/sources.list.d/pgsql.list

And add the entry:

deb [arch=amd64] http://apt.postgresql.org/pub/repos/apt/ cosmic-pgdg main

If you are running an older version of PostgreSQL I STRONGLY recommend you PURGE it and install 11 using the deb repository above.


$ sudo -s								Elevate to Root
# su postgres							Become user postgres
$ createuser -s -P wildfly				Create role "wildfly" in PostgreSql (on my dev machine both the database role and password is wildfly)
$ createdb -O wildfly -E UTF8 mold		Create database "mold" and make role "wildfly" the owner in PostgreSql
